    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>My name is Frida Eriksson, I am 32 years old and currently working for Härnösands Kommun as nursing staff.
         I live in a apartment with my two cats and spend alot of my free time by the computer or with family. I like coding alot more than I like designing, something that might show in this webpage.
    </p>

    <p>
        In my youth i worked as a waitress in a restaurant and in 2010 i started working for the domestic service in Härnölsands kommun. 
        In 2012 I got a jobb at RIK assistans as a personal assistant taking care of children with disabilities. 
        2017 I started working at Älandsgården as nursing staff and I am still working there now, while studing system development.
